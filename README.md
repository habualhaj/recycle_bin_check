# recycle_bin_check

Since there is no direct way in Windows 10 to check the size of the recycle bin and when it was last emptied, recycle_bin_check uses RBCmd to check for the size of the recycle bin, and the date of the oldest deleted file in the recycle bin.

Dependencies:

 1. **RBCmd.exe**: https://github.com/EricZimmerman/RBCmd
 2. Python 3.x
 3. pandas
